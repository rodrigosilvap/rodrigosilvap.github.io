they've made it clear the central banks and the government that they want
everybody to take a shot to the face they want demand to go down and I think
that's already happening quite fast
demand for what? stuff so if they put up
your mortgage rates you spend less in restaurants if you're finding your food
bills at the supermarket 30 higher than they were you spend less on something
else the price of goods moves either because there's not enough Supply which
is what we've had a problem with or it's because there's too much or not enough
demand so if you've got something with restricted supplies so let's think of
oil right now because of the Russian situation there is not enough oil for
the current demand out there so the oil price keeps going up so you and I pay
more to drive our cars or to heat or cooler houses the only way of solving
that one because you can't get the Russian oil back into the market is to
make us use less oil the price does that automatically because it gets more
expensive we do it but if you can also then just lower General demand for
things we'll drive our cars less we'll catch less flights all of that stuff and
that lowers demand and therefore prices because prices rising inflation is evil
for our savings because the dollar in your bank account is worth less than a
year's time it's currently worth eight percent less which is quite a lot it's
this weird situation where we have to take the pain we're told we can't buy as
much and we're forced into it by Rising a mortgage costs and our food costs and
all of this stuff and eventually things will slow down people will be put out of
jobs a bit and then the overall demand in the colony comes down and prices come
down we're all collectively taking the pain for this inflation that was created
out of a whole bunch of different things from the pandemic through to supply
chain issues through to under investment in Commodities through to the shift to
Green energy all of these things have created this moment in time which is
tricky so the feds can engineer it by trying to raise interest rates and it
filters through to our mortgages and other stuff or the market kind of clears
of its own accord where prices get too much people stop buying stuff prices
fall back again so either way tends to work and we're in this weird mess where
the Federal overdoing it the markets are doing it and we're having to take all
the pain in the meantime I generally think that the market is better at doing
it if you actually see it you know from my perspective somebody closely follows
interest rate markets and stuff like that they did all of the tightening
anyway well before the FED people like you hear the expression the feather
behind the curve what it means is the bond Market's already priced it like
interest rates need to go up to slow down the economy because there's too
much inflation and the Federal Reserve are trying to catch up I actually think
the markets do a pretty decent job prices rise eventually it gets too
expensive we stop doing it now there's different equations that people fear is
when it becomes super entrenched in the economy and we all go to our bosses and
go I want a pay rise and everybody does that at the same time that pushes up
prices further you get more wage Rises and that's a wage price spiral that
really has only happened in the US really once which was in the late 70s
early 80s when all of the Baby Boomers hit kind of 30 years old at the same
time so if you think when you go back to 30 you're kind of settling down with
somebody you're probably thinking about buying a house you're buying a car you
know you've got a job you're starting to earn some money we had the largest group
of people in all history turning 30 at the same time and they all did the same
thing and bought the same stuff and that really pushed up prices and that was at
the same time there was issues with oil supply and other things so we had this
double whammy the demand shock and a supply shock which meant prices went
crazy but that's really only happened once my view and it still remains even
though it seems pretty unfashionable right now with inflation at eight and a
half percent as prices go up the economy slows down with the exact mechanism and
therefore it becomes self-regulating and it becomes that because people are quite
in debt and it's a very old population in the US and Europe and elsewhere so if
you raise prices on your retired parents they can't earn more money because
they've got a pension and that's it so what happens is they have end up buying
less and there's a big cohort of people so that's why I think it automatically
over time kind of self-corrects but the other mechanism is the bond market which
is a fancy name for saying interest rates the price that you and I and
companies and governments can borrow so if it becomes more expensive to borrow
so think of your mortgage if you've got a mortgage well then if it comes more
expensive to borrow then you spend less so the interest rate Market forces
demand to come lower now let's say you don't have a mortgage and you're a
renter well the person you rent from has a mortgage so they will raise your rent
because of it which is why everybody's feeling this pain now feeling a bit
poorer and that's the issue that's here however they have one more other thing
in their Arsenal and that is the balance sheet printing money or taking money out
of the economy and they have been printing money for a long time to offset
the pandemic and the extra borrowing that was required I.E when they print
money they're buying the bonds of the government so the Federal Reserve are
buying the bonds of the government so it allows the government to borrow more
without causing any problems right now they're about to start tightening
quantitative tightening people hear the terminology and what that basically is a
fancy word for we're going to take some money out of the economy if they stop
state of easing which is the first step which they've done that's not putting
any money in extra money in when they do quantitative tightening they take money
out so there's a big pool of money sitting there and they say listen we're
going to take five percent of that out every year less money around they sell
the bonds that's on their balance sheet so they have trillions of dollars of
this stuff sitting around where they've stimulated the economy and then what
they do is push it back into the economy and the idea is it pushes up wages or
all the banks have to buy these bonds now from the government and so then they
buy these bonds and they've got less money left to lend and do other
activities with it is weird but if you break it down to the human element I'm
gonna lend you money when I've got plenty of it and if you're desperately
in need of it because you're going through hard times you'll pay anything
for it and if you kind of would like to borrow some money but aren't desperate
you'll pay a lower rate it's basically as simple as that you know the
transaction between two people is the same thing so if a mate of yours comes
to you and you know they're a terrible creditor but he's a friend you're going
to have to set an interest rate that maybe to make sure that you get
compensated for the risk you're taking and if you don't have much money because
you're feeling a bit tight yourself you're either not going to lend it to
him or charge a bit more money because you could have used that money for
something else leverage allows you to borrow future money to use now so at two
levels humans are terrible we just want everything now we don't want to work for
it if I can borrow it and buy that Rolex watch or my new car right we're trying
to meet our future expectations of ourselves always that's what drives
humans so that's why they use leverage and it's the same with Investments so
they do it for purchasing power to bring that future expectations of themselves
have I earned enough money to buy that car no but if I borrow money I can get
my future self here it's kind of a trade-off because you're actually in
debt and now owe somebody you don't actually own the car you own the ability
to use the car until you pay that off it's the same with a house really and
the other point is for Investments you know people love to borrow money now
because then you can make a bigger investment now but the trade-off is is
what happens if that goes wrong and before you know you get a margin call or
liquidated and you know that's a feature we see a lot in the crypto markets for
example that happens kind of automatically humans just love this
stuff because it brings their future expectations of themselves closer I
could be richer I could have more stuff that I deserve now from my income you
can get in trouble if you can't pay your interest so let's say the economy slows
down and you lose your job now what seemed like a reasonable payment
suddenly becomes impossible and any inner arrears and then you get the
little tap on your shoulder which is like I'd like that house back now
because you don't own that house we the bank do this is what people don't
understand with leverage you don't own that thing you only own it when you pay
it off so that's what happens when you lose your job you then can't afford to
pay your mortgage payments now there's a difference between the US and Europe for
this so the US you'd give the keys back to the bank it's not the end of the
world in Europe the debt stays with you oh God yeah very different they get the
house back and you still owe the debt correct because the house is valued less
particularly when what you get we refer to as negative equity you buy a house
for 300 Grand and it's now worth 200 Grand you owe the bank 100 Grand now
it's okay if you can still make the payments and eventually you just pay off
the mortgage but the moment you can't they're like well you owe us 100 Grand
and they take you to court and you carry that and you go to bankruptcy so we know
we're going to take a kick to the face but you've got the baron Rothschild
quote so what everybody knows is buy when there's blood in the streets but
the original quote supposedly was buy when there's blood in the streets even
if the blood is your own so there's going to be a moment where everybody
else is going to panic we're living in that moment right now people are
freaking out the euphoria that we had six months ago has transitioned into a
sort of cynical fearful thing now people are not necessarily looking for
opportunities and that may cause them to miss a tremendous moment it would seem
to me that what you have to understand is the macro Market what is going on we
are certainly in interesting times right now so we've got whatever economic
crisis is going on in China they are locking down now again because they have
a zero covet policy we've got war going on in Europe we have potentially a
global recession headed our way we certainly have inflation maybe there's
things we can do to fix it paint this macro picture for us explain to me the
debt angle and how they stop it from imploding debt at economic level happens
four different places one is governments it's called the deficit you hear this
terminology it's basically how much the government borrows they'll borrow from
people foreign entities corporations anybody who wants that rate of interest
that they will give them for it so you have the US government you have the U.S
households individuals us you have corporations and you have the financial
system those four combined are about 300 and something percent of GDP GDP is the
amount of activity in the economy every year in dollar terms and they've
borrowed an extraordinary amount this is the most indebted us has ever been so to
put it in perspective the US is about 25 of the global economy
yet they have a hundred percent equivalent of global GDP and debt so
this is the most indebted economy in the history of world economics in terms of
global debt because it's so big now the US is not the only one here Europe's got
massive debts Japan's Got massive debts China's got big debts everyone's got
debts because we borrowed for our future selves you know why get enough tax
income for the road system I need to build why not just issue more bonds and
build it now because the bet is I'll create more productivity in the future
and then GDP grows and it's easier to pay off and that generally works okay
but what happens is when your debt becomes so large and something happens
to your income then you start to say well can I pay this debt so we talked
about that part the other part is everything's backed by collateral that's
the thing that you pledge when you take out debt now if collateral Falls too
much in value somebody touch on this soldan says that stuff you gave us in
exchange for the money doesn't cover the money anymore and then you get this
liquidation that we talked about this can't happen on a economic level it can
happen to you and I but we can't let it happen systemically because then
everything goes so we came very close to the edge in the US and Europe in 2008.
so much so that the banking system seized up entirely because the
collateral the house prices went down and then the banks were like oh we
don't have enough money against all of this and then people weren't paying
because we're going to recession that big Doom Loop happens in Europe it came
we got that but there was another one in Europe which was the EU crisis this time
it wasn't the banks that were in trouble it was the governments Italy Spain
France Portugal Greece couldn't pay their debts and then that was the really
holy moment is if whole countries that part of Europe these are big
massive Nations can't pay their debts then we're all fights because then
that's the whole banking system gone that's the whole system of government
everything on so they stack stop the system by saying we'll do whatever it
takes this was Mario draghi's favorite famous term so the basically the EU got
together and said we will buy these bonds to stop them falling to price in
bankruptcy because against government bonds as we talked about it's the
risk-free rate well if it's not risk-free then all of the other debt
that's borrowed on top of it would have blown up to that's been the answer since
2008 is to print currency to buy bonds which is known as currency debasements
and there's many purists in the financial markets it doesn't work that
way the mechanism but it's very clear that this is basically monetary
debasement what monetary debasement means for anybody doesn't understand is
let's say you're thirsty Tom I sell you a bottle of water you want to buy it
because you're thirsty so I can charge you five dollars for it then let's say
I've got 20 bottles of water well it's not that panicky to get that one bottle
so it might clear at three dollars for that bottle of water if I've got a
million bottles of water what is worthless right so the more you create
of something the less value it has if the there's one Picasso it's worth a
fortune if Picasso had made 5 000 of exactly the same painting they're worth
less so we see that with for example one-on-ones of Warhol versus warhol's
Factory where he produced very similar pieces they're worth less than the other
so scarcity versus abundance what you do when you print more money means there's
more money around lowers the value of the money that's debasing currency this
is why they can't let the system go bust because now there's so much leverage
that everything goes and we saw this in Argentina Amos moment in Argentina in
2001 I believe it was called el corralito where the argentinians
couldn't pay their bills the government so what they did is they had this dual
economy the Argentinian peso and a dollar base peso they just took all the
dollars from the bank accounts and convert them into Pesos so they got the
dollars themselves to pay their debts but basically utterly destroyed the peso
and destroyed the economy so much so that Argentina reverted to Bata it was
an extraordinary moment in time that's the a risk the other time we saw
something similar in a more developed country was Cyprus Cyprus a European
country now Cyprus they had a financial crisis there was too much debt it was
based around property and so what happens is the banks were insolvent like
they were in the US and like they were in Europe but the answer was the ECB
said we're not bailing you out so what they did is took any deposit out of the
banking system over a hundred thousand Euros and took it so it wasn't your
money even if it's in a bank it's not your money these are the laws of
unintended consequences that happen if you allow the collateral to go under if
we were less levered like in India the country's very unlevered call it 60 of
GDP in debt in a fast-growing economy it's going 10 a year that's like you
taking the mortgage out and the mortgage isn't that big and you've got great
income right the probability of you not being able to pay that debt it's very
low so it doesn't matter if Indian assets fall a lot and stuff like that
because there's nothing systemic there you're not going to destroy the
population but when it's the us or Europe you can't allow it you just
simply can't because also part of this is you've got this huge old population
of retired people or people trying to retire if you allow the market to clear
then their savings pool disappears we've all gone through parts of our career
where we've lost a bunch of money and we make it back you know you work hard but
you can't do that when you're 75 years old what's lost is lost and then you
have to halve your spending because you've just lost half your pool of money
and you don't know how long you're going to live for so this is why there's so
much complexity with old populations lots of debt you just can't allow the
system to go under it's because when you're able to borrow because you're the
richest dude in the street wins the most money which is the United States and
humans have a propensity to borrow to create the image of their future self
their future self was the amazing United States of America that dream that we had
in the 50s a dream died decades ago and to fund that dream the mismatch between
the dream and the reality is debt sometimes debt is not all bad right
sometimes it can help accelerate some of the things but if you're doing it to
fund a dream that's never going to exist that's the danger so let's talk about it
in financial Market terms or macro terms I think there's three things you need to
do here one income income rules the world income
pays your bills income can pay your mortgage income does everything without
income you've got nothing income takes hard work it's hard to get up the ladder
earn more income secondly is you need to have optionality you need to have things
that can pay off a startup or a hobby business on the side can give you
optionality because you can build a business and a business has intrinsic
value plus it can increase your income so focus on your income work hard look
for other opportunities that can leverage that income and opportunity set
that you've got for you and then thirdly is if I've got this income look for
investment opportunities that can change my life and that doesn't mean being a
degenerate Gambler simply put if there is a thesis for example this is a
long-term and highly volatile you should be looking at the moments of extreme
weakness the blood on the streets moment to be buying more not on Leverage but
just putting your money into it so if you'd have bought a house after the 2008
crisis you'd have done very well if it had bought it at the peak you'll have
done less well right so timing matters so what we should be doing is using this
thinking of the money you've put in as your retirement money and writing it off
and then just adding if you've got money in a bear market now the problem is is
most of us don't in a recession but a friend of mine taught me very early on
he said well there's a key thing I've learned is he who has cash in a
recession is king So that's that combination of income and opportunity
you've got income you've got some cash and now everything's on fire sale prices
you're the king there's a lot of macro similarities with the past past episodes
and everybody makes it very dramatic there tends to be a lot of Doom porn you
know everything looks like the 1929 crash everything looks like we're going
to go to World War II everything looks like it's 2001 all over again yes those
things happen but things go on and if you bought tech stocks after 2001 crash
you'd be very very wealthy indeed if you think of Jeff Bezos he launched Amazon
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed has his IPO it explodes in price and was like oh
amazing an online Bookseller it then Falls 96 and then what happened is well
unlike most of his investors he held on and it went up a lot again still didn't
make up the high it fell another 80 it went up again it then fell 60 and then
before you know it this online Bookseller was suddenly worth more than
all the book selling companies in the world added together and it was still
trading at a price earnings ratio of like 800 everyone's like this is crazy
this is a bubble but what we didn't realize is he was building a network
this network for e-commerce and then the computing power that drives it and so
over time Amazon just did that and these are the things you need to think about
in this is where are we in the volatility and is this going to survive
those are the two questions and if the long-term trend is there then you should
be buying into all of this
